## About

CryptoShield is an AI crypto analyzer created to detect early signs of malicious crypto-mining activities in networks. It utilizes ML and computational models to detect abnormalities on CPU and memory metrics. Matplotlib and Numpy are leveraged to create visual models of network metrics and alert the users of potential threats. A Python-based prototype is provided here as a base for companies and individuals who may want to contribute and make the project better. This project is still a work in progress and many improvements are possible to make it more powerful.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6
- Matplotlib
- Numpy

### Installing

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the repository
3. Install the prerequisites
```bash
pip install <package>
```
4. Execute the Python script
```bash
python main.py
```

## Goals

The main goal of CryptoShield is to create a robust and efficient cryptocurrency analyzer. It should be able to extract metrics related to resources utilization, transaction flow and network usage. The analyzer should be able to detect anomalies and alert the user of potential threats.

Furthermore, the analyzer should also be able to accurately calculate blockchain-related indicators such as hashrate, mining difficulty and mining rewards.

## Roadmap

CryptoShield is still a work in progress and there are many improvements to be made. Here are some items to work on for further development: 

- Improve accuracy of anomaly detection
- Add more blockchain-related indicators
- Expand the list of cryptocurrencies to analyze
- Improve visual models
- Utilize Machine Learning for more accurate predictions
